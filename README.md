# Tests

> I'd like all your tests built in [CodePen](http://codepen.io), if you don't
have an account create one now so you can save these and look at them later.

> If you get stuck there are plenty examples in [CodePen](http://codepen.io)
doing super crazy things so I'm sure you'll find someone that at least sort
of applies to what you're doing.

### Understanding console
> Read [Blake's presentation](https://github.com/blaketarter/dev-tools-presentation) 
on console he gave the office the other day.

> This is super important as it will make your life easier as you go 
through these tests and learn more JavaScript.

### Triggering events on click
> When someone clicks a button that says "I want to leave" the webpage 
will popup a message saying "please don't leave me".

### JavaScript Array
> Output a simple list that looks like this. Using a JavaScript array.

> #### Favorite cheeses!
* extra sharp cheddar
* provolone
* brie
* mozzarella
* parmesan

> Using this array
```
var joshCheese = [
  "extra sharp cheddar",
  "provolone",
  "brie",
  "mozzarella",
  "parmesan"
]
```

### JavaScript Object
> Almost the same as the array but much more complicated. 
I won't give you the Object this time, but only how I want the 
finished product to look. :)

> #### Favorite cheeses!
* cheddar
  * sharp
  * medium
  * extra sharp white
* provolone
  * just buy the whole wheel
* brie
  * smoked if available
* mozzarella
  * once again, buy the wheel
    * just do it you won't regret it
* parmesan
  * not in the can please...
  
### Math

> I made a [pen](http://codepen.io/fabean/pen/ClveA) on CodePen all you need 
to do is write the JavaScript. You'll have to "fork" this pen and save it on
your profile.

> Everything is built for you, all that's missing is the JavaScript. 
What you need to do is when someone submits the form you grab what 
they typed in and put it in the math equation a^2+b^2=c^2 then output 
it to the page in the answers section.

### Buggy code

> Debugging code is super important, so being able to debug some of my code 
is a good test if you understand how to use the console and how code should look.

> Here's the [pen](http://codepen.io/fabean/pen/hmefn) I made, there should be 
a couple errors in there. So you'll need to 'fork' it again to 
save your own un-buggy version. I sort of feel mean about this one, it's pretty
hard as it's just a complicated JavaScript problem to figure out anyways.
